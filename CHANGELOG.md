# Changelog

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-29

Compatibility: ONVIF_C_VERSION 100 → 200. New capability
package — Device/Media/Events statics, WS-Discovery Bye/Resolve,
WS-Security UsernameToken (PasswordDigest) with 401 challenge path,
Media2 minimal face. No breaking API changes (additions only).

## [Unreleased]

- `feat` time-management hooks (issue #22, MiBeeNvr clock-sync
  integration): `SetSystemDateAndTime` is now parsed (DateTimeType
  Manual/NTP, DaylightSavings, POSIX timezone, UTC date/time — by local
  name, namespace-prefix agnostic) and offered to the new
  `onvif_c_config_t.on_set_system_date_and_time` hook; return false to
  answer a Sender fault instead of the ack. Without the hook the
  historical ack stands (documented placeholder — the request is NOT
  applied). `SetNTP` lands via `on_set_ntp` (FromDHCP + first NTPServer
  token: DNS name / IPv4 / IPv6); without it the action keeps its
  ActionNotSupported fault. New pure-C `core/onvif_time.{c,h}` parser
  (host golden tests) and `onvif_xml_fault_sender`/`onvif_xml_set_ntp_ack`
  builders.

### Added — Media2 minimal face (issue #18)

- Decision recorded: **minimal subset in** (not Media1-only, not full) —
  `GetProfiles` / `GetStreamUri` / `SetSynchronizationPoint` under tr2 on
  `/onvif/media2_service`, advertised via `GetServices`; ~1.6 KB of code
  by sharing the Media1 profile template. Media1 bytes untouched.
- GetStreamUri answers the Media2 plain-`Uri` flavor; sync point fires
  the `on_keyframe` seam.

### Added — optional WS-Security UsernameToken (issue #17)

- `core/onvif_wsse.c`: self-contained SHA-1 + Base64 + the ONVIF digest
  formula `BASE64(SHA1(B64(nonce) + created + password))` — no mbedtls,
  ~2.5 KB of code.
- `onvif_c_config_t.auth_password` enables the gate: every action except
  pre-auth `GetSystemDateAndTime` requires a valid PasswordDigest token;
  rejections answer HTTP 401 + a `NotAuthorized` fault.
- Created freshness window (`auth_window_secs`, default 300 s), bounded
  16-slot nonce replay cache, constant-time comparisons,
  `auth_allow_password_text` opt-in (insecure without TLS).
- Default behavior unchanged: no `auth_password` = open LAN service.

### Added — protocol completion batch (issues #13/#14/#15/#16)

- Device: `GetServices` (Namespace+XAddr per served service, Events
  gated), `GetScopes` (element form), `SystemReboot` (protocol answer),
  `SetSystemDateAndTime` (ack), `GetServiceCapabilities`.
- Media: `GetVideoSources`, `GetVideoEncoderConfiguration(s)`,
  `GetVideoEncoderConfigurationOptions`, `SetVideoEncoderConfiguration`
  (ack), `GetGuaranteedNumberOfVideoEncoderInstances` (1),
  `SetSynchronizationPoint` (fires the new optional `on_keyframe`
  config seam), `GetServiceCapabilities` (multicast explicitly off —
  Start/StopMulticastStreaming stay ActionNotSupported by design).
- Events: `GetEventProperties`, `GetServiceCapabilities`,
  `SetSynchronizationPoint`. Multi-subscription and bounded long polling
  remain deliberately out (esp_http_server workers must never block).
- WS-Discovery: multicast Bye from `onvif_c_stop()` (short-lived socket
  owned by the stop caller); Resolve/ResolveMatches for our own address.
- New host goldens pin all new response bytes (ASan-clean).

- **Optional task-watchdog subscription for the WS-Discovery task**
  (`wdt_watch_discovery` config field, default false): the loop paces
  itself with a 5 s receive timeout, so a wedged discovery task stops
  feeding `esp_task_wdt` and the hosting project's TWDT fires. Requires
  `CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT`; compiles out cleanly otherwise. The MiBee Cam
  firmware family enables this family-wide as part of its watchdog
  capability rollout.

Robustness wave from the v0.1.0 code review (issues #6–#10):

- **Send paths no longer trust snprintf would-be lengths as byte counts**
  (#6). `SEND_BUILT` degrades an overflowing response to the standard SOAP
  fault instead of reading past the buffer; the three WS-Discovery `sendto`
  sites (initial Hello, periodic Hello, ProbeMatches) skip truncated frames
  with a warning. Oversized integrator strings (model / serial / stream URI
  / scopes) can no longer cause heap or stack over-reads — pinned by tests
  that run the huge-string paths and by the new ASan/UBSan CI job.
- **SOAP body reads loop over `httpd_req_recv`** (#7): a partial read (one
  TCP segment) is reassembled instead of degrading to
  `ter:ActionNotSupported`.
- **PullMessages assembly checks bounds before every write** (#8): per-append
  truncation checks make `cap - off` underflow impossible; the response
  buffer size is a named constant (`ONVIF_EV_RESP_MAX`).
- **CI runs the host suites under ASan/UBSan** (#9) — the stub harness
  drives the shipped port layer, so length-arithmetic regressions trap.
- **Security posture documented in the README** (#10): no ONVIF
  authentication is implemented; the deployment assumption (trusted LAN) is
  now stated explicitly in both languages.

## 0.1.0 (2026-09-20)

First release. Initial extraction from the MiBee Cam firmware (GPL-3.0-or-later,
single-contributor, re-licensed MIT with the owner's approval), hardened with
a full TDD harness before release.

### Library

- SOAP Device/Media service: `GetSystemDateAndTime`, `GetDeviceInformation`,
  `GetCapabilities`, `GetProfiles`, `GetStreamUri`, `GetSnapshotUri`.
- Pull-Point Events service (`tns1:VideoSource/MotionAlarm`, `Source=CSI`,
  `State`, `Score 0-100`): single subscription (new replaces old), 1 h granted
  TerminationTime, 120 s idle expiry, no long polling; non-blocking producer
  hook safe from sensor callback context.
- WS-Discovery responder (UDP 3702 / multicast 239.255.255.250): unicast
  ProbeMatches answering Probes, periodic multicast Hello, retry paths on
  socket/bind/multicast-membership failure. Optional mDNS (`_onvif._tcp`)
  compiles out when `espressif/mdns` is not in the build.
- `onvif_c_config_t` callback seam: every board-specific value (identity, IP,
  stream URI, runtime gates, HTTP port) is injected — nothing is hardcoded.
  `cfg->http_port` flows into every advertised URI (capabilities XAddrs,
  WS-Discovery XAddrs, subscription address); default WS-Discovery scopes are
  resolved once at config time (no cross-thread static-buffer rebuild).
- No XML parser, no dynamic state, ~10 KB code footprint; response bytes are
  byte-stable and pinned by golden tests.

### Quality gates (CI-enforced)

- Host tests (`tests/run.sh`): 213 checks — core goldens plus the full
  ESP-IDF port layer driven through stubs (fake httpd, fake clock via
  `-Wl,--wrap=time`, pthread tasks, virtual UDP network). gcc + clang.
- Coverage gate (`tests/coverage.sh`): ≥80% lines over `core/` + `esp_idf/`
  (this release measures 95%).
- Style gate (`tools/check_style.sh` + `.clang-format`): clang-format clean,
  pinned `clang-format==22.1.8`.
- Hygiene gate (`tools/check-repo-hygiene.sh`) and a pre-commit hook
  (`tools/setup-hooks.sh`).

### Tools / docs

- `tools/onvif_probe.py` — no-hardware smoke probe (every served action +
  full Pull-Point cycle).
- Bilingual README (EN / zh-CN) with quality-gate, byte-stability and
  integration documentation; CONTRIBUTING with the TDD workflow.
